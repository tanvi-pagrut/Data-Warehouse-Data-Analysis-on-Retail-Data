# Data-Warehouse-Data-Analysis-on-Retail-Data
Point of Sale (POS)-Based Labor Planning: A Data Warehousing Approach to Enhance Retail Decision-Making

POS Data Analysis and Data Warehousing:

This repository contains a Python script and associated source files for analyzing Point of Sale (POS) data. The project initially involved learning and implementing Couchbase and Apache NiFi for NoSQL and ETL operations. However, for ease of use, these steps can be skipped, and users can directly work with the provided source files.

Overview:

The project focuses on:

Data Cleaning: Preparing the data for analysis by cleaning and transforming it using Pandas. Data Warehousing: Creating a structured MySQL data warehouse for storing processed data. SQL Query Analysis: Executing SQL queries for in-depth data analysis.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x Pandas, NumPy MySQL Connector Python Access to a MySQL database

Installation:

Clone the repository. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. Install required Python libraries using the command: pip install pandas numpy mysql-connector-python.

Usage:

Use the source files provided in the repository. They contain pre-extracted and partially processed data. Update the MySQL database connection details in the script as per your environment. Run the script to perform further data cleaning, load data into the data warehouse, and conduct SQL query analysis. Explore the generated output and SQL query results for insights.

Note:

The initial steps involving Couchbase and Apache NiFi ETL workflows are part of our learning process and are not required for users of this repository. Users are encouraged to focus on the data cleaning, data warehousing, and SQL analysis aspects of the project.
